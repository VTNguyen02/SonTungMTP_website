            When Son Tung rose quickly from indie tracks like Cơn mưa ngang qua to mainstream stardom, many underground rappers accused him of abandoning the underground culture and “selling out” to pop.
            Underground rappers like Andree Right Hand, Rhymastic, and B Ray openly criticized Son Tung for copying styles from K‑pop and rap beats from the underground without giving credit.
            Some accused him of using ghost producers and presenting himself as a self‑made artist, which clashed with the underground ethos of authenticity.
